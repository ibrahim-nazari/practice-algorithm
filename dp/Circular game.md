of the stone from the center of the circle, and its value is the distance of the stone from the center of the circle , Each participant throws the stone into the circle twice and the score of this participant is the sum of the points , if the
stone is placed outside the circle , the negative score is one , and if it is placed on the circle , it is zero. the circle is adjusted so theat the stone is placed in a place with the integer coordinates
Note: that the winner is the one with the lowest score
